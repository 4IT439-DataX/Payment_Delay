## Data Understanding
### Data Description Report

The initial data was provided in a comma-separated values file, and was loaded and processed using the R programming language. Dataset used in this analysis contains 2 353 012 observations and 24 variables.

|Column name|Description|Type|Values|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|contract_id|Unique identificator of the contract|Int|{1,2,3,…,N}|
|payment_order|Order of the payment|Int|{1,2,3,…}|
|due_date|Payment deadline|Date|YY/MM/DD|
|payment_date|Date of the payment|Date|YY/MM/DD|
|product_type|Type of the product|Factor|{1,2,3,4,5}|
|contract_status|Contract status|Factor|{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}|
|business_discount|Business discount provided|Factor|{0,1}|
|gender|Gender|Factor|{1,2}|
|marital_status|Marital status|Factor|{1,2,3,4,5,6}|
|number_of_children|Number of children|Int|{1,2,3,…}|
|number_other_product|Number of other products|Int|{1,2,3,…}|
|clients_phone|T/F if the client filled in home phone|Factor|{True, False}|
|client_mobile|T/F if the client filled in mobile phone|Factor|{True, False}|
|client_email|T/F if the client filled in email address|Factor|{True, False}|
|total_earnings|Earning bucket|Factor|{level1,…, not_declared}|
|birth_year|Birth year of the client|Int|{1990,1991,...}|
|birth_month|Birth month of the client|Int|{1,2,3,…}|
|living_area|Region of the client home address|Factor|{1,2,3,…}|
|different_contact_area|T/F if the client filled different home and contact address|Factor|{True, False}|
|kc_flag|T/F if the client does not home local citizenship|Factor|{True, False}|
|cf_val|If the special measure during the underwriting was applied|||
|kzmz_flag|T/F if the client filled in employer|Factor|{True, False}|
|due_amount|Installment what should be payed|Numeric|(0,…)|
|payed_amount|What was payed at a certain date|Numeric|(0,…)|

#### Value ranges

#### Attribute correlations

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(correlogram, title("Correlation between numeric attributes"))
```

We computed correlation coefficients between all possible pairs of numeric variables and discovered strong positive correlation between due amount and paid amount. This could be due to the fact that in the event that the installment has already been paid, the due amount and the paid amount would assume the same value. Correlation between the remaining pairs of numeric variables was either nonexistent or negligible.

We tested for correlation between paired numeric samples using Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient and found the following pairs of attributes to be correlated:




#### Basic statistics

```{r statistics}
summary(data_collection[c(1:24)])
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Data Exploration Report

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
